My name is Nathaniel Budijono.

I'm a life-long autodidact currently studying computer science and math at [the University of Minnesota](https://umn.edu). In the future, I hope to be an interdisciplinary computational researcher using computational structural biology or computational chemistry to create technologies for health and the climate.

Right now, I am reading
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos with Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering* by Steven Strogatz
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang

You can view my résumé [here](/resume.pdf) and my CV [here](/cv.pdf).

Aside from learning, I am passionate about STEM communication and advocating for students with unconventional paths through the education system.

Feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:nathanielbd@gmail.com). I am always excited to connect with people!

Please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/nathanielbd/blog/pulls) if you think I wrote something inaccurate.
