My name is Nathaniel Budijono.

I'm a life-long autodidact and recent graduate. I studied computer science and math at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Right now, I am a data scientist doing machine learning for education at [Infinite Campus](https://www.infinitecampus.com/). In the future, I hope to be an interdisciplinary computational researcher using computational structural biology or computational chemistry to create technologies for health or the climate.

In the past, I have worked as a software engineer intern at [Rally Health](https://www.rallyhealth.com/) and AI research intern at [Smart Information Flow Technologies](https://www.sift.net/). I spent time [researching genetic interaction networks](http://csbio.cs.umn.edu/), the linguistics of incels, and [automated AI balancing of auto battler games](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21550). You can view my CV [here](/cv.pdf) and my résumé [here](/resume.pdf).

Aside from learning, I am passionate about STEM communication. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I created the websites for the [Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers](https://sase-labs-2021.github.io/) and [App Developers Club](https://adcumn.org) at my university. At both, I led workshops, mentoring groups, and projects to learn machine learning, control systems, and web programming. I am helped make biotech start-ups more accessible with [the NucleateDojo (formerly BioDojo)](https://www.nucleate.xyz/dojo/). You're visiting my personal site, where I blog about STEM topics by explaining them in a way I have not seen anywhere else on the internet, whether it be by using custom animations, interactive demos, and/or an interesting application.
