My name is Nathaniel Budijono.

I'm a life-long autodidact currently studying computer science and math at [the University of Minnesota](https://umn.edu). In the future, I hope to be an interdisciplinary computational researcher using computational structural biology or computational chemistry to create technologies for health and the climate.

In the past, I have worked as a software engineer intern at Rally Health and AI research intern at Smart Information Flow Technologies. I spent time researching genetic interaction network visualizations and sampling algorithms to find developable proteins. You can view my CV [here](/cv.pdf).

Aside from learning, I am passionate about STEM communication and advocating for students with unconventional paths through the education system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I created the websites for the [Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers](https://sase-labs-2021.github.io/) and [App Developers Club](https://adcumn.org) at my university. At both, I led workshops, mentoring groups, and projects to learn machine learning, control systems, and web programming.

Right now, I am helping make biotech more accessible with [the BioDojo](https://bio-dojo.com/) and reading
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos with Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering* by Steven Strogatz
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang
