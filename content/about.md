My name is Nathaniel Budijono.

I'm a life-long autodidact currently studying computer science and math at [the University of Minnesota](https://umn.edu). You can view my résumé [here](/resume.pdf).

Learning things is my ultimate pursuit. I believe in open educational resources. I like to write about the learning and teaching process.

When I'm not learning, I can often be found board gaming, video gaming, or watching something funny.

Feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:nathanielbd@gmail.com) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/nathanielbd/nathanielbd.github.io/pulls) if you think I wrote something inaccurate.
