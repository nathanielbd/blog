Hendrik Lenstra's elliptic curve factorization method (ECM) is one of the fastest for factoring integers. It employs a clever trick on top of drawing inspiration from [Pollard's \\(p-1\\) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard's_p_%E2%88%92_1_algorithm). While it can be implmented in Python without the use of exceptions, I believe a good way of [grokking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok#In_computer_programmer_culture) it is to implement it using exceptions to closely follow its description in *An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography* by Hoffstein, Pipher and Silverman.
