| Happy 164th birthday, Aleksandr Lyapunov! |

I recently participated in the first annual [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) math animation engine hackathon! The theme was anniversaries, so I created the above animation to celebrate the 164th anniversary of mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov's birth. This extended some ideas I presented from [Steven Strogatz's nonlinear dynamics textbook](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering) at the University of Minnesota's [math directed reading program](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~mahrud/drp/) symposium. Here's the [source code](https://github.com/nathanielbd/animating-strogatz) for the animation and visualizations.

# The math

Consider the system

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{dx}{dt} &= y-x^3 \newline
	\frac{dy}{dt} &= -x-y^3.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can't use linearization about the fixed point at the origin to determine its stability; the Jacobian has pure imaginary eigenvalues, so the linearization is not robust to small nonlinear terms.

However, Lyapunov showed that finding a Lyapunov function \\(V\\) which is locally positive definite and has a locally negative definite time derivative implies stability. This is similar to an energy function as the trajectories move monotonically down the basin of \\(V\\). Let's try \\(V = x^2 + y^2\\) for the system.

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{dV}{dt} &= \frac{dV}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{dV}{dy} \frac{dy}{dt} \newline
	&= 2x(y-x^3) + 2y(-x-y^3) \newline
	&= 2xy -2x^4 - 2yx -2y^4 \newline
	&= -2x^4 - 2y^4
\end{aligned}
$$

\\(V\\) is non negative and \\(\frac{dV}{dt}\\) is non positive, so it truly is a Lyapunov function. Its existence implies that the system is asymptotically stable; trajectories all eventually converge to the origin. 

So the key insight that Lyapunov found was that there doesn't need to be a real energy function, nor does a system have to be physical; all you need is a Lyapunov function that satisfies a few properties to determine its stability.

Outside of this toy example, Lyapunov functions are used in the engineering of nonlinear control systems. Their analogue in [control-Lyapunov functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Lyapunov_function) has been used in [robotics for path planning around obstacles](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/3.21375).
