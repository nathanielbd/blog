An incomplete list of some things I've worked on outside of jobs and school that aren't mentioned in the blog. All of the projects have their own GitHub repository of code either on [my profile](https://github.com/nathanielbd) or one of the organizations on my profile.

# 2021

I got my first industry research job!

# 2020

I turned 18 years old!

A multiplayer trivia game named after [a classmate's quote on Jeopardy!](https://www.twincities.com/2020/04/17/umn-sophomore-nibir-sarma-wins-jeopardy-college-championship-claiming-100000-grand-prize/). I created the [playable webapp](https://nathanielbd-whodaman.zeet.app/), [a tutorial](https://github.com/ADC-UMN/multiplayer-trivia-game), and [open-source community version](https://github.com/ADC-UMN/whodaman-ce) where anyone can contribute to learn by doing! Playing the role of Alex Trebek at App Developers Club Fall Kickoff brought me great joy.

## [MacZero](https://github.com/nathanielbd/MacZero)

Implemented the Advantage-Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to improve the performance of an LSTM trained on user inputs by defeating two additional enemies. It plays in real time, but it can't beat Mike Tyson yet. Perhaps letting it play frame-by-frame or using a [decision transformer](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/decision-transformer) could make that possible?

## [Gopher Tunneler](https://github.com/SASE-Labs-2020/gopher-tunneler)

A webapp to help students navigate the notoriously labyrinthine system of underground tunnels at the University of Minnesota called the 'Gopher Way.' I taught collaborative programming with git and GitHub along with React development to our team of engineering students inexperienced with programming.

## [Neurolens](https://github.com/nathanielbd/neurolens)

A hackathon submission I made with my partners to Caltech's hackathon. We won 'Best Artificial Intelligence & Computer Vision Hack', 'Best Social Good Hack', and 'Best Hack Using Machine Learning' awarded by Citadel. While we didn't end up working on the projectI past the 36 hours of the hackathon, it did give me a good excuse to play around with the computational chemistry package `rdkit`, webscraping PubMed, Flask web development, and deploying on Google Cloud Platform. I'm no longer hosting the webapp live, but you can read a more comprehensive write-up and view more of images of the website [here](https://devpost.com/software/neurolens).

# 2019

I got paid to engineer software for the first time!

# 2018

I graduated high school!

## [Cold Crisp Catnap](https://github.com/nathanielbd/cold-crisp-catnap)

A vanilla JS webgame I made as I was learning JavaScript. *Ready Player One* and its featured classic text-adventure game *ZORK* was fresh in my mind. You can play the game and find my easter eggs [here](https://cold-crisp-catnap.neocities.org/). I have since learned about text parsing and frontend frameworks, so I plan to remake this one.
